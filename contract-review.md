## Make Your Agent Publicly Accessible 

Once you are satisfied with your agent answers, you can make it securely available to your GenAI applications via an API Endpoint.

Go back and edit your agent, make sure you set it to `External`
![Set Agent Public](./images/contract-external.png)
**Click Save**

Wait 1-2 minutes and your agent now has Public API endpoint

Click `Copy endpoint`
![Set Agent Public](./images/contract-agent-endpoint.png)

Your agent has an Aura API endpoint.

### Generate Aura API Keys
You will need to generate API keys for an external application to authenticate to your endpoint.

Go to Your Account settings page and locate `API Keys`
![Set Agent Public](./images/generate-api-keys.png)

Click `Generate API Key`, give it a name and make a note of your new `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

Keep `Client ID and Secret` secure. Do not share.


### Test Your Agent from Terminal
Verify external access by opening a terminal window

Run the following commands
```
export CLIENT_ID=<enter your Client ID here>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<enter your Client Secret here>
export ENDPOINT_URL=<enter your agent endpoint URL>
```

Get an Aura API token
```
export BEARER_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST 'https://api.neo4j.io/oauth/token' \
     --user "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' | jq -r .access_token)
```

Ask your Agent a Question via the agent API endpoint
```
curl --request POST "$ENDPOINT_URL" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"input": "find Motorola contracts"}' --max-time 60 \
  | jq .
```

Your agent reply looks like this
